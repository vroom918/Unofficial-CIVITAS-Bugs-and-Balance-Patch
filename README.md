# Unofficial CIVITAS Patch

A Civ 6 mod which fixes some bugs with various other mods in the [CIVITAS Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1205609555) and makes some balance changes. I do not own those mods nor am I affiliated with them, but they're quality stuff and just missing a few things.

## Requirements

None! This mod should be compatible with any version of Civ 6, any DLC, and any mod list. Aside from creating localization entries, all of the changes are only applied if the thing they're trying to change already exists. So whether you have none of the CIVITAS civs or all of them this mod should be safe to use.

## Install Instructions

Clone this repository, then copy the `CIVITAS-Patch` folder into your Civ 6 Mods folder (defaults to `C:\Users\<you>\Documents\my games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods` on a Windows Steam install).

## Changes

### Bug Fixes

- Djoser:
    - Use the correct descriptions for the Sphinx and Maryannu Chariot Archer in the leader select screen
- Malaysia:
    - Dermagas give Commercial Hubs +2 gold adjacency like the Harbor that they replace
- Seleucid:
    - Fix incorrect and missing text for the Argyraspides' ability
- Taino:
    - Bateys give Theater Squares +2 culture adjacency like the Entertainment Complex that they replace

### Balance Changes

- Djoser:
    - Gain a governor title upon recruting a Great Engineer (inspired by the Darius I ability, another CIVITAS leader)
    - Reduce Great Engineer points from Overseer of Stoneworks from +2 per wonder to +1 per wonder
- Darius I:
    - Improvements only build roads on their own tile (mostly because I didn't like the way it looked)
- Seleucid:
    - Farms give +0.5 gold to Agoras and Pastures give +2 (instead of +1 each; inspired by the Observatory)

### Known Issues

- Djoser:
    - I don't think Overseer of Stoneworks is actually working; needs more investigation
    - The Great Engineer Imhotep has not been renamed

- Normandy:
    - The Man-At-Arms has not been renamed

- Taino
    - The Batey improvement (from Caguana) has not been renamed
